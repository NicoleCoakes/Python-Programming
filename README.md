# Python-Programming


Vehicle Checkin: 


  Assigned while studying at Purdue University, MGMT 586
  Purpose: allow a user to document vehicles received by a car dealership. 
  Skills included:
    Variable creation and modification. 
    Effective comment writing.
    Accumulators.
    Appending values onto global variables to calculate shipment totals.
    Readable and user-friendly formatting in the final printout. 
  Limitations:
    As part of the class we were only allowed to use the skills learned in Automate the Boring Stuff chapters 1 and 2 (up until the Flow Control portion). 
      Loops, dictionaries, and functions were not permitted during this assignment. 
    I also created the same function using a while loop. It can be found in the "Vehicle Checkin (With While Loop)" program file.

Vehicle Checkin (With While Loop):


  Same as above, but using a While Loop instead of reiterating the same block of code over and over. 
  This program allows the user to enter as many vehicles as they want, but because we were not permitted to use dictionaries, the 
    information isn't stored anywhere. Each variable is overwritten with each loop. That said, results are printed out at the end
    of each loop, so for the purposes of the assignment it does meet the "print each vehicle and summary numbers" criteria.

  Coffee is for Closers:

  
    Assigned while studying at Purdue University, MGMT 586
    Purpose: To allow dealership salespeople to quickly calculate a customer's maximum loan principle and monthly payment. 
    Skills included:
      Function building, with two multi-pass functions in the program. 
      Gather input from users, assign it to variables, and then derive multiple additional variables based on those inputs. 
        (i.e. calculate monthly values from annual ones, convert annual interest to monthly, etc.)
      Accumulator to label and organize loan information by loan number. 
      While loop to continue the program until the user indicates that they have no additional loans to process. 
      if/elif/else loop for customer's max payment based on their credit score.
